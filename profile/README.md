# Studies&Me public profile

## Welcome

Our job is to provide value. The better we can communicate what we do, the easiere it is to understand the value we provide.

Having a changelog is something which helps us communicate to stakeholders, but also provide value internally.

To be able to generate an changelog we are using strict format for writing commit messages.
We are following this standard https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

##### Format of the commit message
     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body> if need a more descriptive can be added 
     <BLANK LINE>
     <footer>
     
##### 99% of my commit messages is a one liner like this 
      refactor: a shot explanation of the change
     
##### To be more specific
      refactor(component): a shot explanation of the change
     
##### Allowed types
     feat (feature)
     fix (bug fix, when something did not work as expected, but is now fixed)
     chore (maintain, build tasks, changes from staging to production)
     tests (when a test has been added or updated)     
     refactor (most often used, with WIP (work in progress) )
     design (design changes) 
     perf (performance improvements)
     text (adding text or fixing spelling mistaks visible to the user)
     revert (when you need to go back in time )
